This was my 12 Game Jam that I hosted, the theme was "twitch" and the number one rule was that everyone had to
make a web game that didn't require a plugin. I used jawsjs.com for mine. 

Idea: 
This wasn't my original idea, the orginial idea was for objects to fly from every side of the screen and the shape you
control had to dodge them... But things didn't work out that way and I turned the broken code into this.

Objective:
So the game is far from perfect, kinda buggy even... But the goal is to start moving the little square with the
arrow keys (don't stop moving!) and touch the green shapes as you create them! The more you get the higher your score.
If you touch the red shapes it will remove your life.

Bugs:
I am not doing any real clean up so after a while things will slow down also the way the shapes spawn and interact with
the player is a bit weird. Lots of other little issues... But it works soooooo yeah. 

Controls:
For the main menu and game over screen use spacebar key. During game play use all the arrow keys to move around.

Experience:
Considering I was using javascript to make the game I actually really enjoyed the experience. Been using Flixel and I
think jaws mixed with netbeans 7.3 might be my tool of choice ofr simple game creation. jaws handles a lot of the grunt
work for you and just lets you make stuff. 

Things to improve:
Code wise I do want to implement some namespacing and create some base classes instead of hardcoding them all in the 
actual game state code. As for the game itself, hm... Interesting idea, maybe one day i'll revisit it. 

Tools:
NetBeans 7.3
howler.js
jaws.js
Audacity
